Abstract

ESMValTool is a software tool for analyzing data produced by Earth System Models (ESMs) in a reliable and
reproducible way. It provides a large and diverse collection of “recipes” that reproduce standard, as well as
state-of-the-art analyses. ESMValTool can be used for tasks ranging from monitoring continuously running ESM
simulations to analysis for scientific publications such as the IPCC reports, including reproducing results from
previously published scientific articles as well as allowing scientists to produce new analysis results.

Software reliability and reproducibility is of the essence for ESMValTool. Our main strategy for ensuring reliability
is modular, integrated, and tested design. This comes back at various levels of the tool. We try to separate commonly
used functionality from “one off” code, and make sure that commonly used functionality is covered by unit and integration
tests, while we rely on regression testing for everything else. We also use comprehensive end-to-end testing for all
our “recipes” before we release new versions. Here we describe the testing infrastructure for both ESMValCore, the autonomous
computational engine framework that runs the analyses provided by ESMValTool, and for the package comprising
scientific diagnostics and metrics. Our testing infrastructure ranges from basic unit tests to tools that smartly handle
various file formats, and use image comparison algorithms to compare figures. This greatly reduces the need for ‘human testing’,
allowing for built-in robustness through modularity, and a testing strategy that has been tailored to match the technical
skills of its contributors.
